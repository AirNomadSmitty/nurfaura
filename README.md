# URF Pickem
##Description
With URF Pick'em, we animate a gold graph and update champion KDAs as the game is progressing. The object of the game is to pick the winner of the game as early on as possible. The earlier you pick, the more points you get. Keep guessing until you get one wrong, then save your score to the leaderboard. The demo is hosted here: http://ec2-54-148-243-198.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

##Dependencies
- "aura/cli-kernel": "~2.0",
- "aura/web-kernel": "~2.0",
- "aura/sql"       : "~2.0",
- "aura/view"      : "~2.0",

- "monolog/monolog": "~1.0"

For some request logging

- "guzzlehttp/guzzle" : "~5.0"

The crowd favorite PHP library for hitting APIs

- Angular JS

##Future Goals
Given the length of the competition and our work schedules, many things got ommitted. We're both developers without much knowledge/experience in design so we opted not to waste too much time on that. Ideally we'd like to make the app more appealing.

Many ideas got scrapped due to time constraints. One main one that we would've liked to have in there is a working killfeed. In an ideal world, we wanted to pull some champion-specific sound files from the client and play them on each kill. We also would've liked to pair this with a map that updates with positions where champions died over the course of the game.
